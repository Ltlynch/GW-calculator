Liam will add in the three maps:

At the top of the page we would like it to say:

"The following are three different maps of the sky displaying the current pulsar timing array's (PTA's) strain upper limit as a function of sky position.
In areas of the sky that are denser with pulsars, the PTA is able to limit
smaller strains.  Each map corresponds to a specific frequency and confidence 
level, specifically the confidence with which we can say that a source of that strain
does not exist.
So notice that as the confidence decreases, the strain also decreases.
The maps displayed here are  a subset of the maps used to calculate the probability of detection in the calculator. 
These maps were generated based on the current data within the pulsar timing array and are provided by Sarah Vigeland, Joe Simon. For more information on how they were created, please see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11585.pdf.


Next to the first map should read:
"95% Confidence Upper Limit for a frequency of ______"

The second map:
"75% Confidence Upper Limit for a frequency of ______"

The third:
"50% Confidence Upper Limit for a frequency of ______"
