"Hello and thank you for making use of our Gravitational Wave Calculator. 

Liam Lynch and Drew Evans are members of the undergraduate class of 2019 at Haverford College. They helped prepare this page as part of their Senior Thesis. Evans focussed heavily on making the page as accessible as possible to any user regardless of background with Gravitational Waves and Pulsar Timing. Lynch's own research aided in his focus on creating the maps and calculations the page was intended for.

They were advised by Andrea Lommen, who received her Ph.D. in Astrophysics from UC Berkeley. She currently conducts her research with the Pulsar Timing Array through the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) and prevously helped start the NANOGRAV research group."
